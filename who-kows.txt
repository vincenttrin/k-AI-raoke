I'll probably be a waste of your time, but who knows?
Chances are I'll step out of line, but who knows?
Lately, you've set up in my mind
Yeah girl you, and I like that
Lately, I've been thinking that perhaps I am a coward
Hiding in a disguise of an ever-giving flower
Incompetent steward of all of that sweet, sweet power
Yesterday was feeling so good, now it's gone
I'd feel like that always if I could, is that wrong?
Tell me 'bout the city you're from
Is it hot? Does it snow there?
Lately, I've been thinking 'bout my precarious future
Will you be there with me by my side, my girl, my shooter?
Who's to say who calculates? Not me, I'm no computer
Is it a crime to be unsure?
In time, we'll find if it's sustainable
You're pure, you're kind, mature, divine
You might be too good for me, unattainable
Maybe we get married one day, but who knows?
Think I'll take that thought to the grave, but who knows?
I know that I'll love you always
Yeah girl you, and I like that
