00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:27,399
-♪ I'd probably be a waste of your time, but who knows?

00:00:27,419 --> 00:00:27,439
♪

4
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:36,626
Chances are I'll step out of line, but who knows?

5
00:00:38,628 --> 00:00:41,530
Lately, you've set up in my mind.

6
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,374
Yeah, girl, you and I like that.

00:01:33,974 --> 00:01:37,400
I feel like that always if I could.

11
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:42,049
Is that wrong?

12
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:45,175
Tell me about the city you're from.

13
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:47,018
Is it hot?

14
00:01:47,038 --> 00:01:49,182
Does it snow there?

15
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:17,476
Me by my side, my girl, my shooter Who's to say who calculates?

16
00:02:17,957 --> 00:02:34,204
Not me, I'm no computer Is it?

17
00:02:35,112 --> 00:03:01,508
A crime to be unsure In time we'll find If it's sustainable You're pure, you're kind Mature, divine You might be too good for me
