00:00:00,537 --> 00:00:08,569
Performing, who knows, from his new album, Son of Spurgy, please welcome Daniel Caesar!

2
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:27,557
I'll probably be a waste of your time, but who knows?

3
00:00:30,558 --> 00:00:34,884
Chances are I'll step out of line, but who knows?

4
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,933
Lately, you've set up in my mind.

5
00:00:41,534 --> 00:00:45,539
Yeah, girl, you and I like that.

6
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:51,087
Ooh.

7
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:59,299
Lately, I've been thinking that perhaps I

8
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:31,092
Hiding in the disguise of an ever-giving flower Incompetent steward of all of that sweet, sweet power Yesterday was feeling so good Now it's gone

9
00:01:33,839 --> 00:01:36,442
I feel like that always if I could.

10
00:01:37,423 --> 00:01:38,905
Is that wrong?

11
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:44,231
Tell me about the city you're from.

12
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:46,313
Is it hot?

13
00:01:47,014 --> 00:01:48,756
Does it snow there?

14
00:01:57,946 --> 00:02:02,631
Lately I've been thinking about my precarious

15
00:02:03,218 --> 00:02:27,437
future will you be there with me by my side my girl my shooter who's to say who can't you ladies not me I'm no computer

16
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:39,009
Is it a crime to be unsure?

17
00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:46,680
In time, we'll find if it's sustainable.

18
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:55,952
You're pure, you're kind, mature, divine.

19
00:02:56,473 --> 00:03:02,942
You might be too good for me, unattainable.

20
00:03:15,005 --> 00:03:41,890
Maybe we'll get married one day, but who knows?

21
00:03:44,941 --> 00:03:49,749
I think I'll take that thought to the grave, but who knows?

22
00:03:53,054 --> 00:04:04,333
I know that I'll love you always, yeah girl you and I'd like that.

23
00:04:14,658 --> 00:04:15,260
Come on!

24
00:04:16,605 --> 00:04:18,130
That's how you do it right there!

25
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,474
Come on, Daniel Caesar!

26
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,147
Son of Spurgey is out now!

27
00:04:23,187 --> 00:04:25,073
We'll be right back, everybody!
